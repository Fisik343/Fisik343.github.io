        Here's an entire space dedicated to questions I've asked myself about
        this site that you may be asking as well (if you are asking questions
        about some internet stranger's website, please seek professional help --
        this is not something you should be wasting time concerning yourself
        with). This is primarily just me entertaining myself some more.
