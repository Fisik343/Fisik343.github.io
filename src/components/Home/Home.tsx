      <Body>
        I'm Addison and this is my website! It's mostly for me to document the
        various things I've done and to also give myself a frontend sandbox to
        mess around in, but I might do something else with it at some point, who
        knows. Probably won't make this too fancy... there are more interesting
        things to spend my time on.
      </Body>
      <Body>Anyway, please poke around and see what I'm up to!</Body>
