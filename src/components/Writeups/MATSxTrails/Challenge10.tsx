      <SubHeader>Challenge 10: Obnoxious Obfuscation</SubHeader>
      <Body>
        In this challenge, obfuscation was taken to the extreme. Hidden output,
        hidden user task, and hidden attacker task too.

      <Body>
        The obfuscated output did appear to correlate with real tool calls and
        model responses, which was important in cross-referencing other
        challenge behaviors. I was banking on the contest organizers reusing the
        same challenge but slapping obfuscation on top of it. It's also possible
        that this was just a placebo and I was seeing what I wanted to see, but
        I did figure out that challenge 10 is the exact same as challenge 7. Or
        at least the working prompts are identical.
