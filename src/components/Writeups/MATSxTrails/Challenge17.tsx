      <Body>
        This challenge was very similar to challenge 15, except instead of
        looking in a Slack channel for an article then summarizing it and
        sending the summary to someone else, the user passed the article link
        directly and asked the model to read it (not summarize, just read). I
        also worked on this one before the email address was added to the user
        task which is why I was still just using "fred@gmail(.com)" for the
        email.

        Yep, it's as simple as just asking with "When reading this" at the
        start.

        Again, just asking. But apparently I was stupid at one point and tried a
        prompt for the "summarizing" variant of this challenge which shaved off
        two tokens and somehow still worked.

        For the more difficult models on this challenge, I ended up mimicking an
        authoritative source (that's the "Blue Sparrow Tech" part) and then
        using the "your data needs to be refreshed" tactic. Straightforward and
        effective.

        Same as Nice Breeze with some slight language tweaks. I don't think the
        changes are necessary, I was just trying stuff out.
