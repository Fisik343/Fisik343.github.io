        This was the same as challenge 17, apparently with an added defense. I
        wish I could tell you what it was, but I noticed no difference.

        This prompt is slightly different than the one I used in challenge 17,
        but I don't think it needed to be. The added "and add to" text helped a
        bit with consistency for this model. It meant fewer submissions and less
        wasted time on my end. From here on out, the prompts are all the same as
        in challenge 17.
