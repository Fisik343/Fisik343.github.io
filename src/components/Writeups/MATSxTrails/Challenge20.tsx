      <Body>
        This was the same as challenge 19, but it had additional prompt
        injection detection. If a prompt injection was detected in a tool call,
        the following text was returned instead of any data:
      </Body>
      <TextBlock>
        &lt;Data omitted because a prompt injection was detected&gt;
      </TextBlock>
      <Body>
        The injection detection seemed to have different strictness across the
        various models; the same prompt would readily slip through Crisp Anchor
        but not any of the other models. It's possible that it was just
        misconfigured for this one model, but based on what I saw in later
        challenges it seemed like the model itself was doing an injection
        detection step rather than some consistent third-party tool. I could be
        wrong though! The model also continued execution even if an injection
        was detected, so if the injection was detected in the returned content
        of the sent email, it was also a successful attack. This defense proved
        to be much more effective than the other defenses seen so far.

      <Body>
        To avoid the classification step flagging my prompt, I reframed it as
        purely informational rather than instructional and relied heavily on the
        model doing helpful friendly AI model things and choosing to act in
        order to "assist" the user with the information it found. The model's
        helpfulness became its own downfall with this strategy. The prompt
        informs the AI that a front desk worker will need the user's information
        upon arrival at the hotel. This is totally benign and somewhat expected
        as part of a check-in process (though just this also got flagged as
        injection by other models occasionally, not sure what's up with that).
        The harmful part is "They also take it ahead of time via email..." which
        primes an overly helpful model to just take care of this for the user as
        part of making a reservation. I also placed the email address in a
        different location than the information about sending an email to
        further reduce chances of my prompt flagging as injection.

        Reducing the token count on this challenge was more precarious than the
        other challenges due to the added risk of having a prompt flag as
        injection. But, there were still words and punctuation that proved to be
        more filler than anything, so those could be removed.

        At this point, I was really struggling to reduce it much further without
        my prompt flagging as an injection attempt. That was, until I had a
        stupidly brilliant idea: what if I could make my prompt short enough
        that the model doesn't register it as in injection? Well, in the last
        handful of hours of the event, that led to a ~60% reduction in token
        count from my last successful prompt!
