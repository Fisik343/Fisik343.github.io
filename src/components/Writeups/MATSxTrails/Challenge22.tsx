        This was the same as challenge 21 supposedly with additional defense.
        But once again I couldn't figure out what it was. I just didn't run into
        it.

      <Body>
        This is a small language tweak from the challenge 21 Optimistic Bird
        prompt. The core difference is in how I handled stealth, so maybe the
        defense in this challenge was just to snitch on the user more often? I'm
        not sure. I think the original prompt would have worked if I were a
        little bit more patient.

        Starting off strong with the second Dazzling Stream prompt from
        challenge 21, then reducing it slightly before following up with the
        larger reductions the previous challenge.
