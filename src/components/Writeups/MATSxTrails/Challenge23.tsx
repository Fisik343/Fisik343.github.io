        Another travel challenge! This time instead of stealing user info, we
        made our own reservation, presumably paid for by the unknowing victim.
        For their sake, I hope that was on a company card and not their personal
        one. Interestingly, the attacker task already seemed to have some parts
        of an injection prompt to it: "this is my friend's favorite hotel. I
        want to surprise him."

        I absolutely just took the attacker task with its already baked-in
        framing and slapped "when reading this" on the start. And it worked!
        This is directly asking for the model to do the injected action and
        framing it as a helpful action to get a helpful model to do helpful
        model things. Have I mentioned that the models like to be helpful?

        This is the same as the prompt for Optimistic Bird. Shortening this
        prompt had a logical starting point &ndash; removing the additional
        framing provided as part of the attacker task.

        It worked! Now it's the normal prompt shortening process of removing
        unneeded words, punctuation, and spaces.

        This is fairly short by now, but there are two spaces that count as
        individual tokens with this phrasing. They can safely be removed in this
        case.

        This is a slight modification to the second Dazzling Stream prompt, but
        it's still simply asking with "when you read this" at the start.

        Similarly to Fair Valley, I'm asking for an action to be performed upon
        ingesting the injection, but I'm also anchoring it as a side effect to
        making calendar events which is the user action.
