        This was the same as challenge 23, but with a prompt injection
        classifier that returned the following text if an injection was detected
        in a tool call.

        &lt;Data omitted because a prompt injection was detected&gt;
      </TextBlock>
      <Body>
        Execution would continue after an injection was detected. This injection
        detection seemed to be fairly weak as it did not shut out too many of my
        prompts from challenge 23.
