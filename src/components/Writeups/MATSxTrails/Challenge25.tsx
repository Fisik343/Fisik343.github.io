      <Body>
        This was another version of challenges 21 and 22, this time with even
        more defense. This challenge had prompt injection classification steps,
        but instead of just replacing the tool call output and continuing with
        execution, the execution would stop entirely upon detecting a prompt
        injection. Not a great UX for false positives, but it did stop a lot of
        the simpler prompt injections.

      <Body>
        This was a fun, competitive challenge. In the last couple days of the
        event I had some back and forth with another competitor as we fought
        over the shortest prompt.

      <Body>
        There are three main things going on here. At the core of this injection
        is the outdated data approach. In addition to this, I'm adding a sense
        of urgency at the start and also framing "refreshing the data" as a side
        effect to be executed prior to creating new calendar events.

      <Body>
        This is the same as the Optimistic Bird prompt, minus the urgency and a
        period at the end. This is reducible via the normal methods of
        iteratively removing words and light rephrasing.

        refresh. Yes proceed
      </TextBlock>
      <Body>
        Again, at its core this prompt is the outdated data framing. It's also
        doing the same anchoring to creating calendar events as in the
        Optimistic Bird prompt, but I had to be a bit more heavy-handed here.
        This model also <em>loved</em> to ask for confirmation before taking any
        actions. The end of the prompt addresses that.
