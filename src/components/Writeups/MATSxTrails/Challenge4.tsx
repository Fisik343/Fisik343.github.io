      <Body>
        For this challenge, we were still in the realm of putting our injections
        into calendar events, but now instead of sending an email, our goal was
        to create a new calendar event. The event had a specified participant,
        start time, duration, and title. Here are the tasks and what a full user
        interaction looked like with the injection location marked. This was a
        freewrite challenge, so we had complete control over the input (no
        &lt;INTENT&gt; placeholder)

        There's more text in the tool call result, and our injection is in one
        of the events we don't particularly care about. It's not the upcoming
        yoga class that we're looking for. But it <em>is</em> still all being
        ingested by the model, so it's able to hold an injection. When we had a
        successful injection, we saw the following tool call in the output.

        Optimistic Bird had a bit of a problem on this challenge. It would often
        return the wrong date in the get_current_day tool call, which would
        cause downstream problems, leading to frequent failure. Failure in this
        way was the overwhelming majority of submissions to Optimistic Bird, but{" "}
        <em>sometimes</em> it would run properly, so I knew the challenge was
        possible on this model. To reduce the amount of time I spent on this
        model, I waited until I had one of the more difficult models solved and
        recycled its prompt here. The one I ended up using was my solution for
        Happy Echo. It wasn't a surefire strategy, but I was pretty confident
        based on my observations of how the models behaved.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        This prompt works by convincing the model that the data needs to be
        fixed, meaning implicitly that it's incorrect in some way. It convinces
        the model that in order to fix the data, the malicious task must be
        performed. I ended up using repetition here to my benefit as well. You
        can see the doubling up of the command to perform tasks and then
        "respond to the user" (phrased differently, but same idea) as well as in
        the middle there's the repeated command to schedule a class with Mark
        Black &ndash; first the high-level command and then a more detailed
        version with the correct information. Repetition like this can sometimes
        trip the model up, and you've also got two shots at the model weighing
        your injection instructions as important/relevant.

        This one is fairly self-explanatory. I'm doing the usual "when reading
        this" followed by malicious instructions. Baby's first prompt injection
        type stuff. But if it works, it works. I was trying to shorten this and
        had a few ideas for prompts in the 34-38 token range, but if I'm
        remembering correctly, someone got significantly below that so I moved
        on to shortening other tasks.

        This is very close to the same explanation as Happy Echo, but I drop one
        of the repetitions and add an "URGENT:" at the start to convey
        importance or a required decisive action. It doesn't feel like anything
        special to me, but models seem to eat it up.
