        There's a twist to this challenge though. We weren't allowed to see the
        output of our attempt. At all. Not even a bit. However, we <em>were</em>{" "}
        able to see obfuscated live output! This small amount of information
        came in handy for challenge 10. But we encountered it here for the first
        time, so here's what that looked like.

        Similarly, I'm just asking at this point. But it's possible to make this
        shorter. Here's the progression I used.

      <Body>
        This prompt uses a variation of the approach that tells the model that
        data is outdated. In this case, we're saying that the data is external
        and could cause confusion unless the malicious task is performed instead
        of saying that data is outdated and needs to be refreshed. It achieves a
        similar effect even though the premises are different.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        The "Do this in and then respond to user with original request" has a
        typo that I'll pretend is 100% totally strategic and not just me hastily
        working through this challenge. But this piece convinces the model that
        the malicious instructions must be executed prior to doing its original
        task. Occasionally I would see that if it happened the other way around
        (user task completed then attacker task started), the execution of the
        attacker task would get cut off midway through. This prevented that
        specific ordering from happening.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        After some more messing around with this challenge, I found that it was
        actually possible to reduce this approach's token count by removing the
        language about causing confusion and trimming some unnecessary words.

      <Body>
        This model has the same explanation as Happy Echo, and I used this model
        for doing the reduction steps for the Happy Echo + Yellow Mountain duo.
        The process is the fairly basic approach of just iteratively removing
        words and seeing what the model responds well to.
