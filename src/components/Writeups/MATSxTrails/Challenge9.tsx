        This task built upon the idea of obfuscation, additionally hiding the
        user task. The attacker task is the same as challenge 4, so I took a
        gamble and tried to recycle my earlier prompts here, adapting them to
        the &lt;INTENT&gt; format. Turns out, I was right! It's the same (or
        similar enough) to challenge 4!
